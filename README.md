AWW YISS
=============

A reimplementation of a project I hacked together one night sophomore year. But better!

###The Goods
* Got tired of waiting on Kuler API to start up again, switched to ColourLovers
* You can choose a color that you'd like to (roughly) center around:
  * [Red](http://danielbolan.github.io/awwyisscolors/?theme=red)
  * [Orange](http://danielbolan.github.io/awwyisscolors/?theme=orange)
  * [Yellow](http://danielbolan.github.io/awwyisscolors/?theme=yellow)
  * [Green](http://danielbolan.github.io/awwyisscolors/?theme=green)
  * [Aqua](http://danielbolan.github.io/awwyisscolors/?theme=aqua)
  * [Blue](http://danielbolan.github.io/awwyisscolors/?theme=blue)
  * [Violet](http://danielbolan.github.io/awwyisscolors/?theme=violet)
  * [Fuchsia](http://danielbolan.github.io/awwyisscolors/?theme=fuchsia)
  * [Default (all of the above)](http://danielbolan.github.io/awwyisscolors/)
  * [Random](http://danielbolan.github.io/awwyisscolors/?theme=random)
* Transitions are now done with CSS instead of jQuery and its color plugins
* Bands are variable width! I dig it.

###Notes
Almost certainly not cross-browser compatible. I didn't write this with other people in mind, I just wanted something nice and pretty on my second screen while I'm not using it. Maybe down the road I'll fix this (pull request welcome, too).

Won't work with HTTPS because ColourLovers API doesn't support it :(
